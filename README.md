# Smart Dustbin Project

## Overview

Smart Dustbin is an innovative project based on the Internet of Things (IoT), designed to bring about significant changes in terms of cleanliness using technology. The project utilizes the Arduino IDE for code deployment, with an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) for object detection. The integration of sensor technology enables a contactless waste disposal experience, making it accessible and user-friendly for individuals of all age groups.

## Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to leverage IoT technology to enhance cleanliness and waste management. By automating the opening and closing of the dustbin lid based on the proximity of objects, this system contributes to maintaining a cleaner environment. The project aims to utilize cost-effective components, ensuring accessibility for a broader audience and promoting widespread adoption of the contactless dustbin technology.

## Hardware Requirements

1. Arduino Nano
2. Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
3. Servo Motor
4. 9V Battery
5. Dustbin
6. Jumper Wires

## Software Requirements

Arduino IDE is the recommended software for uploading the code to the Arduino Nano.

## Usage

To use the contactless dustbin, assemble the hardware components as per the provided instructions. Upload the provided Arduino code using the Arduino IDE. The ultrasonic sensor will detect objects within a specified range, triggering the servo motor to open the dustbin lid. After a predefined delay, the lid will automatically close. This contactless mechanism ensures a hygienic and efficient waste disposal process.
